But it wasn't clear if evacuations happened in those other cities.

U.N. officials also said Tuesday that 2 million people have fled Ukraine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT AID TO UKRAINE AND SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. and its NATO allies have rejected Ukraine's calls to enforce a no-fly zone over the country so as to avoid direct military engagement with Russia. But Poland said Tuesday that it would give all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S., apparently agreeing to an arrangement that would allow them to be used by Ukraine’s military, though it wasn't immediately clear how such a transfer might happen. Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly Soviet-era fighter jets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, President Joe Biden said \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-europe-global-trade-120c0152cf310a5b593f6ae7a2857e62\">the U.S. would ban all Russian oil imports\u003c/a>, toughening the toll on Russia’s economy even if it will bring rising costs to Americans, particularly at the gas pump. Energy exports have kept a steady stream of cash flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions it faces.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hours after Biden's announcement, Russia’s Central Bank sharply tightened currency restrictions in ways not seen since Soviet times.

Evacuation routes led mostly to Russia and its ally Belarus, drawing withering criticism from Ukraine and others. And Russia continued to pound some cities with rockets even after the announcement of corridors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Such tactics were common during the Syria war after Moscow entered the war in 2015 to shore up President Bashar Assad’s forces.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ARE HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Humanitarian corridors arise when a population is caught in a war zone, particularly when a city or town is under siege. The idea is that hostilities are halted for a certain time to allow civilians who need to flee to do so along designated routes or to allow urgent humanitarian aid to enter for civilians who remain.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The term was first evoked during the Bosnian War in the 1990s, when the U.N. set up “safe areas” for civilians. But the attempt was seen as a failure since the U.N. was unable to protect the zones when they came under attack.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:393483284474' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Humanitarian corridors also have been sought in the war in Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray region have been under a government blockade for months. \u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW WERE THEY USED IN SYRIA? \u003c/p>\u003cp>During the Syrian civil war, the Russian and Syrian militaries pursued a strategy of systematically besieging opposition-held cities, towns and districts, sometimes for months or even years. The sieges rained destruction on the populations, with airstrikes, artillery and rockets blasting residential districts, hospitals and infrastructure. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Eventually in each case, the Russians and Syrians would offer humanitarian corridors, telling civilians and even some fighters they could leave. Most would then be funneled into the northwest province of Idlib, which remains to this day the last opposition-held enclave in Syria. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Humanitarian corridors were created for besieged districts around Damascus and parts of the cities of Homs and Hama. The largest and most famous was for eastern Aleppo in late 2016, capping four years of devastating siege. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WERE THEY SAFE? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Russian and Syrian forces were often accused of breaking the cease-fires surrounding humanitarian corridors with continued bombing of the besieged cities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When they talked about these humanitarian corridors or ceasefires, we never believed them. How can you trust someone to stop who is bombing you all the time?” said Afraa Hashem, a 40-year-old activist who survived the Aleppo siege and now resides in London. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She recalled how during a humanitarian corridor ceasefire on December 14, 2016, the house where she was sheltering with her family was hit by incendiary bombs. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>There were also cases of civilians or fighters being detained by Syrian forces as they tried to use humanitarian corridors despite promises of safe passage. In some cases, opposition fighters reportedly opened fire on corridors, either to prevent people from leaving or to spark clashes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, tens of thousands of people used the corridors to get out of the combat zones. They make up the bulk of the 3 million people crowded into Idlib province, which is surrounded by Syrian forces and is still hit by Russian airstrikes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“After four years under bombs, they forced us to leave, that’s what it is” said Hashem. “They didn’t save us. They put us in another area of bombs, Idlib.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>SO WERE THE CORRIDORS EFFECTIVE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ultimately, they were effective in attaining the goals of Russia and the Syrian government: To regain control of opposition areas. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Critics say Russia and Damascus benefited another way as well by carrying out mass demographic change, removing large opposition populations, many of whom have not been able to return to their homes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Human rights groups and humanitarian agencies point out that under international law, every effort should be made to ensure civilians’ safety no matter where they are.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The tactic of siege-plus-humanitarian corridor, they say, essentially gives residents a brutal choice between fleeing into the arms of their attackers or dying under bombardment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They said the offer also gives an illusion of legitimacy to the mass slaughter of civilians who remain behind once the siege resumes in full force. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is not like Russia can create a humanitarian corridor for two days and then say, ‘Well, we’ve done our job, now we can destroy everything,’” said Sara Kayyali, Syria researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-WorldNews","name":"World News","canonicalName":"world-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Syria","name":"Syria","canonicalName":"syria","isPr":false},{"id":"BasharAssad","name":"Bashar Assad","canonicalName":"bashar-assad","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-mideast","name":"Middle East","canonicalName":"middle-east","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-africa","name":"Africa","canonicalName":"africa","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:62fa232dcb9d6260fef0e9c7f5386f9a","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:62fa232dcb9d6260fef0e9c7f5386f9a","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:62fa232dcb9d6260fef0e9c7f5386f9a","shortId":"62fa232dcb9d6260fef0e9c7f5386f9a","bylines":"By MSTYSLAV CHERNOV and YURAS KARMANAU","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-united-nations-evacuations","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — Corpses lie in the streets of Mariupol.

Just days into the war engulfing his nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is drawing historical comparisons as an effective and stirring wartime communicator — yet with a distinctly modern touch inflected by the sensibilities of live television and the personal feel of social media.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His baby-faced complexion is now usually puffy and pasty, with a faint growth of beard. Suits and dress shirts have been replaced by olive military-style garb. His raspy voice betrays exhaustion. Together, these help form a narrative of personal courage, of David fighting mighty Goliath and refusing safe passage out of his homeland — embodied by his line that he needed “ammunition, not a ride.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>It's all quite a development for a former TV actor and comedian who weeks ago was disdained in some corners as a political novice too eager to seek compromise with Moscow.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Here’s a guy who was basically considered to be a lightweight, out of his element, about to be crushed by a major superpower next door. And it didn’t happen,” says Andrew J. Polsky, a professor of political science at Hunter College in New York and author of a book on wartime U.S. presidents. “I think people really expected that he would flee ... and I think he surprised people by sharing the danger that they were sharing.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:393483284474' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>That, Polsky says, has created “a reciprocal relationship between Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people. I think they have gotten energy from each other and confidence from each other. That’s an impressive communications accomplishment for a leader, to be that much in touch with his people in the middle of a crisis.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Winston Churchill, who rallied Britons during World War II's darkest days, is a name frequently invoked — even by Churchill’s biographer. One analyst compared Zelenskyy to Benjamin Franklin and his success in soliciting French support for the American Revolution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Through interviews and appearances via video link from hidden locations, Zelenskyy has sought to rally the world to Ukraine's side. When he told the European Parliament “we're fighting just for our land and for our freedom,” the translator struggled not to cry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Speaking the other day at a San Francisco fundraiser, U.S. first lady Jill Biden said that “I just have to turn on the TV every morning and pray that Zelenskyy is still alive.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of Zelenskyy's appearances seem designed to deliver that simple assurance. Shortly after Russia invaded, he was seen in what appeared to be mobile phone video from a darkened street in Kyiv, four grim-faced colleagues standing behind him.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We are all here,” he said. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so. Glory to the defenders of Ukraine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Zelenskyy's insistence on staying, along with his wife and children, was a turning point, says Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow and manager of the Ukraine Forum in the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. “People saw he had courage,” she says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has appeared detached and distant, speaking to aides via videoconference or the end of an almost absurdly elongated table, with speeches that Polsky says display a self-created sense of history.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ukraine president's words have projected a mixture of defiance and an escalating desperation, and he seems unafraid of alienating those whose help he might need. For example, he told NATO officials they would bear responsibility for civilian deaths if they didn't enforce a no-fly Zone over Ukraine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Through those messages, he's not just speaking to NATO leaders, but directly to the citizens who may put pressure on them to do more, says Kenneth Osgood, professor of history at the Colorado School of Mines and an expert on propaganda and intelligence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Zelenskyy's pleas remind one analyst of Benjamin Franklin's trip to France in 1776 to elicit French support for the American Revolution — a trip that ultimately proved pivotal to history.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The British had military superiority,” says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a specialist in political communication and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “Had France not joined the war in 1778, the outcome may have been different.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ukrainian leader's persona, message and delivery are mutually reinforcing, Jamieson says. “His delivery straight to camera in closeup is effective social media — unscripted, clear, straightforward and brimming with resolve.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>His messages don't necessarily all have the same impact, she notes. Saying “Don’t let them exterminate us” is a more effective frame, she says, than “calling a NATO summit weak and confused.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jamieson says TV networks have magnified the power of Zelenskyy's appeals with potent visuals, “overlaying evocative images of damaged buildings, fleeing mothers and children, menacing Russian tanks, empty store shelves and the like.” What's more, she says, the specter of his demise always looms: “His increasingly unshaven look, the flak jacket when in public and the repeated reminders to world leaders that this may be the last time they see him alive add immediacy to his appeals.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>That same message — it might be the last time they see him alive — was delivered to members of the U.S. Congress via Zoom over the weekend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois told ABC News that he took notes when Zelenskyy talked. “Calm,” heroic\" and “unprecedented” were among the words he wrote. “I don't think you can sit there with human emotions and not be moved, not be motivated,” Quigley said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He cited the Churchill comparison. So did Andrew Roberts, author of the 2018 biography “Churchill: Walking with Destiny\": Speaking on a Commentary magazine podcast, he noted both Zelenskyy's personal bravery and his refusal to sugarcoat things. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Zelenskyy doesn't possess the same rhetorical prowess as Churchill did in radio messages as German bombs rained down upon London, says Osgood, the propaganda expert. “Zelenskyy is much blunter — sort of, ‘Here’s the story. I’m just going to give it to you straight.’ So there’s not the same poetry to it. But there’s the same desperation.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Indeed, in style, the more formal Churchill and Zelenskyy could not be more different. But each man, Polsky says, mastered the media of his era.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Churchill made good use of radio, the written word as well,\" he says. “And Zelenskyy makes excellent use of casual social media. He walks through the streets and holds his cell phone up, and he talks to people.” His off-the-cuff remarks, with no time to prepare a long speech, add to the genuine nature of his presentations, he and others say, and resonate with a younger generation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Not many people in Ukraine saw Zelenskyy as a great leader before the war, says Lutsevych, at the Ukraine Forum in London. Now, though, he has become the voice of the nation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He has a personal quality, especially being sensitive to your environment, to be able to play different roles, to be sensitive to your audience,” she says. “He's quite empathetic as a leader.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Correspondent Barry Hatton in Lisbon, Portugal, contributed to this report.

(AP) — The high school choir room buzzed with spontaneous song and silliness before the show. Their recent rendition of Disney’s “High School Musical” was the students’ first chance to perform live since the pandemic shut down the world two years ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Everyone was thrilled to be together again, but nervous, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At this point, someone usually shouts, “Break a leg!” MacKale McGuire, one of the show’s stars, responds with a cheeky grin: “I beat you to it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is dark humor from a young man whose left leg was amputated above the knee four years ago after a battle with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. “I’ve said it too many times, and now people just roll their eyes whenever they hear it,” he said, chuckling. “But I love doing it. It’s funny.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"385afeb02fc24827a6d752df2f7987ca\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>MacKale learned to walk again with a prosthetic leg. He returned to golfing almost immediately and eventually played soccer. Inspired by athletes in the winter Paralympics, which were on right about the time of his amputation, he learned to ski on one leg.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Now, on this snowy night in his northern Michigan hometown, he was about to dance across the stage, playing the lead role of Troy Bolton, a jock (like him) who likes to sing. A show that’s heavy on dancing was a particular challenge.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I like to surprise people,” said the curly-headed 18-year-old, whose story has long inspired his small community. Shortly after his diagnosis in 2015, the Cadillac High School boys’ basketball team donned “Team MacKale” shirts in his favorite colors – fluorescent orange and black. Soon, people all over town were wearing them.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"d9557a81b8854852a65ddb3a2509f70f\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>MacKale, also called “Mac,” has been cancer-free for more than five years. He credits the support, especially from his family, with helping him get through challenging times.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But his parents say MacKale has always been pretty resilient, perhaps because he’s dealt with hard things his entire life. He was born with hemophilia, a blood-clotting disorder. So when the cancer diagnosis came, he was accustomed to visiting doctors and hospitals. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"4ac98367ea9e4c86bfe8e40563c52186\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>His mom, Marsha McGuire, says he also seems to have forgotten or compartmentalized the worst moments in his cancer journey – the nausea from chemotherapy that made it hard to eat or the pain from the unsuccessful attempt to use a cadaver bone to save his leg.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After a surgeon in Florida presented amputation as an option in 2018, MacKale quickly agreed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When he had his full leg, he was more handicapped than he is now without his leg. It was like a dead weight,” his mom recalls. “When he had his amputation, it’s like the whole world opened up to him and he seemed more confident to all of us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>MacKale started out as a manager for his school soccer team. His coach eventually encouraged him to play.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just remember that first time and feeling the wind blow through my hair again,” he said. “… I was hooked from then on.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>As a sophomore, MacKale scored a winning goal in a shootout during a tournament game. With the help of a “blade” prosthetic that gave him more speed and agility, he played varsity this season, his last at Cadillac High.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I try to like look for things that I can do, rather than things that I can’t do,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even when the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of life, MacKale said he felt more prepared for the isolation than most.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"5cbdb67db0614cb9b58b8048a0863357\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“While I was in treatment, I was basically in a similar situation -- like people rarely came to see me because I was sick quite often,\" he said. “So it just it seemed kind of familiar in a weird way.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the fall, MacKale plans to go to college. He’s thinking about becoming a pediatric oncologist to help kids in the same predicament he was – though sports management and theater also are appealing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For now, he’s just happy to enjoy the end of his senior year and to savor those moments back on stage.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This could be the start of something new. It feels so right to be here with you,” MacKale sang in one song, as Troy Bolton.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wearing a basketball uniform for most of the show, his prosthetic leg was there for all to see. But he hoped most people eventually forgot about it and just enjoyed the show.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Martha Irvine, an AP national writer and visual journalist, can be reached at mirvine@ap.org or at http://twitter.com/irvineap\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"ae8771e3cdc349c49f7879fe3d4d6cfa\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{"type":null,"background":null},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Coronaviruspandemic","name":"Coronavirus pandemic","canonicalName":"coronavirus-pandemic","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-entertainment","name":"Entertainment","canonicalName":"entertainment","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-Health","name":"Health","canonicalName":"health","isPr":false},{"id":"Soccer","name":"Soccer","canonicalName":"soccer","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Artsandentertainment","name":"Arts and entertainment","canonicalName":"arts-and-entertainment","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Cadillac","name":"Cadillac","canonicalName":"cadillac","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-trendingnews","name":"Trending News","canonicalName":"trending-news","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:6062a65827a9cf1f23ae9139a9ff3d51","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:6062a65827a9cf1f23ae9139a9ff3d51","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:6062a65827a9cf1f23ae9139a9ff3d51","shortId":"6062a65827a9cf1f23ae9139a9ff3d51","bylines":"By MARGERY A.

On Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made clear that his country, Europe's largest \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-environment-and-nature-germany-83aadd6f23b35a7963d5f64618fb8cd9\">consumer of Russian energy\u003c/a>, has no plans to join in any ban. In response, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman hinted that the U.S. could act alone or with a smaller group of allies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Not every country has done exactly the same thing,\" Sherman said, \"but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>DOES THE U.S. BAN ON RUSSIAN OIL HURT MOSCOW?\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The impact on Russia would likely be minimal. The United States imports a small share of Russia's oil exports and doesn't buy any of its natural gas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last year, roughly 8% of U.S. imports of oil and petroleum products came from Russia. Together, the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021, which was roughly 672,000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day. But imports of Russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Because the amount of oil the U.S. imports from Russia is modest, Russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere, perhaps in China or India. Still, it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount, because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting Russian oil.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If Russia were eventually shut off from the global market, rogue countries such as Iran and Venezuela might be \"welcomed back\" as sources of oil, said Claudio Galimberti, an analyst at Rystad Energy. Such additional sources could, in turn, potentially stabilize prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A team of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-europe-venezuela-cbe04e87fca44ed3815aba8dd2b65945\">Biden administration officials were in Venezuela\u003c/a> over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. She said officials discussed a range of issues, including energy security.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“By eliminating some of the demand, we're forcing the price of Russian oil down, and that does reduce revenue to Russia,” said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. “In theory, it is a way of reducing how much Russia earns on every barrel it sells, maybe not by a lot, but by some. The most important question is whether there’s going to be more pressure on the other side of the Atlantic.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW COULD A RUSSIAN OIL BAN AFFECT PRICES?\u003c/p>\u003cp>News of the U.S. oil ban sent \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-05ba4a25cbee9b5281804d3a5b60f058\">gasoline prices surging\u003c/a>, with a gallon of regular selling for an average of $4.17 Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A month ago, oil was selling for about $90 a barrel. Now, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-tokyo-sydney-1ac7c193d204266b2901fe420d32c2c2\">prices are surging close to $130 a barrel\u003c/a> as buyers shun Russian crude. Refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn't resell if sanctions were imposed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-europe-51a9408c615e78d845c2668622fadd35\">Shell said Tuesday that it would stop buying Russian oil and natural gas\u003c/a> and shut down its service stations, aviation fuels and other operations there, days after Ukraine’s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy Russian oil.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to $160 or even $200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning Russian crude. That trend could send U.S. gasoline prices past $5 a gallon, a scenario Biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A U.S. embargo on Russian oil is very politically attractive right now,'' said Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines. Still, the same politicians now supporting the ban \"will come back and hammer Biden if U.S. gasoline prices rise further as a result,'' he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ARE RUSSIAN IMPORTS ALREADY FALLING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the Biden administration and Congress. Even without sanctions, some U.S. refiners have severed contracts with Russian companies. Imports of Russian crude oil and products have tumbled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships” with Russia and voluntarily limit Russian imports, said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s largest lobbying group. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows that imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WILL EUROPE GO ALONG?\u003c/p>\u003cp>A ban on Russian oil and natural gas would be painful for Europe. Russia provides about 40% of Europe’s natural gas for home heating, electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of Europe’s oil. European officials are seeking ways to reduce their dependence, but it will take time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Britain's business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to \"give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports,” which account for 8% of U.K. demand.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Tuesday defended the European decision so far to exempt Russian energy from sanctions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the Russian economy and the Putin regime seriously, but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time,” Habeck said. “Ill-considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have maneuvered ourselves into an ever-greater dependency on fossil energy imports from Russia in the last 20 years,” Habeck said. “That is not a good state of affairs.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak of Russia underscored that urgency, saying Moscow would have “every right” to halt natural gas shipments to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to retaliate against Germany for halting the parallel \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-russia-germany-0d211c6138bb1b4ca57adeba9ca44341\">Nord Stream 2 pipeline\u003c/a>, which wasn't yet operating. Novak added that “we have not taken this decision” and that “no one would benefit from this.” His statement marked a shift from Russia's earlier assurances that it had no intention of cutting off gas to Europe. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Oil is easier to replace than natural gas. Other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to Europe. But much oil would have to be replaced, and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kazakhstan-business-germany-prices-utilities-09ba9bd916525f66cf266ce7b30fa503\">Replacing the natural gas\u003c/a> that Russia provides to Europe is likely impossible in the short term. Most of the natural gas Russia provides to Europe travels through pipelines. To replace it, Europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas, known as LNG. The continent doesn't have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In January, two-thirds of American LNG exports went to Europe, according to S&amp;P Global Platts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While U.S. oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas, its export facilities are already operating at capacity. Expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daly reported from Washington.

All that has just subsided, and now we can go back to focus on learning.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Falling infection rates and new federal health guidance are leading most of the remaining states with statewide school mask requirements to drop the mandates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-87d7bdc811ba6521e32017072d5ea180\">recently issued new guidelines \u003c/a> saying most Americans live in places where healthy people, including students, can safely take a break from wearing masks.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But those hesitant about ending school mask mandates often point to low childhood vaccination rates among American children. Only about a quarter of children ages 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, and about 58% of children ages 12 to 17 are inoculated, the CDC says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois and Delaware rescinded their statewide school mask requirements recently. New Jersey and Rhode Island dropped theirs officially Monday while California, Oregon and Washington have \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-technology-health-california-public-health-c0be203235ff50532167173623e56b59\">jointly announced they'll drop their statewide mandates\u003c/a> effective March 12. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In many instances, the ultimate decisions are being made at the local school district level. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials many large cities, such as Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., have said they'll keep mask rules for now, either until vaccination rates improve among their students, or they can work out agreements with teachers unions, which have been among those most vocal about keeping the mandates in place.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After Chicago schools announced Monday that masks will no longer be required as of March 14, the city's teachers union vowed to take officials to court, saying the move will violate an agreement with the district to keep the mask rule through the end of the school year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In New York City, elementary student Jack Jalaly ditched his mask Monday as they became optional in the nation's largest school district.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think it’s nice because kids can finally see their teachers talk, and I also have a younger daughter who has spent all her time with no face, right?\" said Jack's mother, Andrea. “So for little kids, it’s really great because you can see the way words are pronounced and you can see spellings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But third-grader Derrick Carter-Jacob kept his mask on as New York eliminated the requirement. “I don't want to get COVID,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Leave it on. There’s no reason for him to take it off until basically everybody is safe,\" said his parent, Michael Jacob. \"I want my son to be safe. I’m sorry. That’s the way I see it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>John Bracey, a Latin teacher at Belmont High School in suburban Boston, says he intends to keep wearing his hospital-grade N-95 respirator through the end of the academic year even as district officials are expected to decide on their school mandate later this week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The 41-year-old Bellingham resident said he and his wife have also decided to keep his two young school-age children wearing masks this week even though their district lifted the requirement Monday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have major concerns on so many levels,” Bracey said. “It appears to be a decision made to benefit the most privileged and leaves everyone else to their own devices. We’re sacrificing the health of immunocompromised students, elderly staff and those of us with young children. I just can’t find a public health or moral justification for removing them.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Needham, another Boston suburb, school administrators waited until Monday — a full week after the state eased its mask requirement — in part to prepare students for the transition this week to what they call a “mask-friendly environment,” says School Superintendent Daniel Gutekanst.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He said the work, which included posters and informational videos created by district officials, appears to have paid off, with no reports of major disputes or other issues around mask wearing after classes ended Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Melissa Bello says her two school-age children were among those that gladly removed their masks Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She says her 8-year-old son has hearing loss in both ears and has been complaining of having trouble understanding people in school with everyone wearing masks the last two years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He’s working harder everyday in school and coming home more tired,” Bello said. “There’s not enough consideration for those kinds of tradeoffs in these mask mandates.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Jason Chan, another parent in Needham, said his two school-age children went in Monday still wearing masks — and likely still will through the week before the family reassesses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He believes his children, which include a 5-year-old son who has never known schooling without a mask, would be fine wearing them until the end of the school year, if it came down to it. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Honestly, the kids have been doing better than the parents with the masks,” Chan said. “I hear a lot of parents upset but kids just don’t look at it the same way in terms of this civil rights issue. It’s like wearing a hat or a sweater for them.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press journalist Robert Bumsted contributed to this report.

Last year, the U.S. imported nearly 700,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products from Putin's country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former President Donald Trump, who is nearly alone in his party in calling Putin “smart\" following the invasion, issued a statement noting record-high gas prices and asked “DO YOU MISS ME YET?\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Democratic “policies are why we are here in the first place.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican Rep. August Pfluger, who represents a portion of West Texas’ oil patch, called banning Russian oil imports “great,” but also a “lesser step.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It is time to unleash American oil and gas,” Pfluger said, contending that the White House’s ”assault on the oil and gas industry has created a weakness in the United States.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Caught in the middle is much of the American public, torn between wanting to support Ukraine and pocketbooks ready to be further squeezed. A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday — before Biden’s Russian import announcement — found that as many as 7 in 10 Americans suggested they’d support a “ban on Russian oil,” even if it meant higher gas prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But many drivers said the sticker shock was still a lot to digest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“How long this can go on? Will we be willing to pay four, five dollars, six dollars” a gallon? wondered Vikas Grover, who was filling up in the Washington suburb of Herndon, Virginia, prior to the White House's Russian oil announcement. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It just disrupts the whole budget,” Grover said. “If it becomes unsustainable, you know, this all falls apart.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>David Custer, a Virginia resident who was paying $60 to fill up his SUV before Tuesday’s announcement, said Biden should undo executive actions he issued to protect the environment upon taking office and instead promote U.S. \"energy independence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Those that work to resolve the issue will get my vote,” Custer said. “Those who continue the path that we’ve been on recently will not.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, Asiya Joseph, who was filling up her tank in Brooklyn, New York, said, “I don’t think that it’s fair to blame the Democrats for something that may be somewhat not under their control.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is a response to what’s happening over in Ukraine,” said Joseph, who added that COVID had also likely contributed to higher prices. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Samantha Gross, a fellow and director of the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the Democratic-leaning Brookings Institution, said gas prices were already on the rise as global markets coped with increasing demand as the coronavirus pandemic began to recede — but are up even more amid questions about international supply because of the Russia-Ukraine war.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You drive down (the road) and there’s the price and a great big sign right next to you. So we’re always really aware of what gasoline costs. And it’s often a big political issue for whoever’s in charge in the presidency and Congress,” Gross said. “But, the truth of the matter is, is that oil prices are set on a global market based on global conditions. And there’s very, very little that Congress or the president can actually do about them.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if Biden were to loosen environmental rules, it's unlikely oil and natural gas production around the U.S. could ramp up fast enough to ease currently spiking prices at the pump. In the meantime, the Biden administration has approached oil-rich Venezuela and its socialist President Nicolás Maduro — drawing still more criticism from Republicans. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Never should we think that foreign oil is better than American independence when it comes to energy,” said Rep. Yvette Herrell, a New Mexico Republican. She also criticized the Biden administration for scrapping work on the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline. Even if that project had been allowed to continue, however, it probably wouldn't have been far enough completed to immediately stabilize oil prices. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Gross said the Biden administration could further tap into the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as it did to try and calm rising gas prices in November. The White House announced Tuesday that it had committed to releasing 90-plus million barrels from the reserve this fiscal year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the short term that’s the way to help keep prices down,” Gross said. “But in the long term, if we continue to see the war effort from President Putin, it’s a difficult situation.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press reporter Dan Huff contributed to this report. \u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"VladimirPutin","name":"Vladimir Putin","canonicalName":"vladimir-putin","isPr":false},{"id":"JoeBiden","name":"Joe Biden","canonicalName":"joe-biden","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-politics","name":"Politics","canonicalName":"politics","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedStates","name":"United States","canonicalName":"united-states","isPr":false},{"id":"Globaltrade","name":"Global trade","canonicalName":"global-trade","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:ded87e709176b8b68921cad2597ff2d7","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:ded87e709176b8b68921cad2597ff2d7","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:ded87e709176b8b68921cad2597ff2d7","shortId":"ded87e709176b8b68921cad2597ff2d7","bylines":"By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN and COLLEEN LONG","canonicalUrl":"capitol-siege-texas-riots","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — A Texas man was convicted on Tuesday of storming the U.S. Capitol with a holstered handgun, a milestone victory for federal prosecutors in the first trial among hundreds of cases arising from \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818\">last year’s riot\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"1st trial in Capitol riot ends in conviction on all counts","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"c47a6475803741518c435d267ca30590","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/ded87e709176b8b68921cad2597ff2d7","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"c47a6475803741518c435d267ca30590","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - This artist sketch depicts Guy Wesley Reffitt, joined by his lawyer William Welch, right, in Federal Court, in Washington, on Feb. 28, 2022.

remember their fishing trips with the grandchildren, how he used to braid her hair, anything to jar him back to his world outside the concrete walls of Cook County Jail.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His three daily calls to her had become a lifeline, but when they dwindled to two, then one, then only a few a week, the 65-year-old Williams felt he couldn’t go on. He made plans to take his life with a stash of pills he had stockpiled in his dormitory.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams was jailed last August, accused of killing a young man from the neighborhood who asked him for a ride during a night of unrest over police brutality in May. But the key evidence against Williams didn’t come from an eyewitness or an informant; it came from a clip of noiseless security video showing a car driving through an intersection, and a loud bang picked up by a network of surveillance microphones. Prosecutors said technology powered by a secret algorithm that analyzed noises detected by the sensors indicated Williams shot and killed the man.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I kept trying to figure out, how can they get away with using the technology like that against me?” said Williams, speaking publicly for the first time about his ordeal. “That’s not fair.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams sat behind bars for nearly a year before a judge dismissed the case against him last month at the request of prosecutors, who said they had insufficient evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams’ experience highlights the real-world impacts of society’s growing reliance on algorithms to help make consequential decisions about many aspects of public life. Nowhere is this more apparent than in law enforcement, which has turned to technology companies like gunshot detection firm ShotSpotter to battle crime. ShotSpotter evidence has increasingly been admitted in court cases around the country, now totaling some 200. ShotSpotter’s website says it’s “a leader in precision policing technology solutions” that helps stop gun violence by using “sensors, algorithms and artificial intelligence” to classify 14 million sounds in its proprietary database as gunshots or something else.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But an Associated Press investigation, based on a review of thousands of internal documents, emails, presentations and confidential contracts, along with interviews with dozens of public defenders in communities where ShotSpotter has been deployed, has identified a number of serious flaws in using ShotSpotter as evidentiary support for prosecutors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP’s investigation found the system can miss live gunfire right under its microphones, or misclassify the sounds of fireworks or cars backfiring as gunshots. Forensic reports prepared by ShotSpotter’s employees have been used in court to improperly claim that a defendant shot at police, or provide questionable counts of the number of shots allegedly fired by defendants. Judges in a number of cases have thrown out the evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>ShotSpotter’s proprietary algorithms are the company’s primary selling point, and it frequently touts the technology in marketing materials as virtually foolproof. But the company guards how its closed system works as a trade secret, a black box largely inscrutable to the public, jurors and police oversight boards.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company’s methods for identifying gunshots aren’t always guided solely by the technology. ShotSpotter employees can, and often do, change the source of sounds picked up by its sensors after listening to audio recordings, introducing the possibility of human bias into the gunshot detection algorithm. Employees can and do modify the location or number of shots fired at the request of police, according to court records. And in the past, city dispatchers or police themselves could also make some of these changes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Amid a nationwide debate over racial bias in policing, privacy and civil rights advocates say ShotSpotter’s system and other algorithm-based technologies used to set everything from prison sentences to probation rules lack transparency and oversight and show why the criminal justice system shouldn’t outsource some of society’s weightiest decisions to computer code.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When pressed about potential errors from the company’s algorithm, ShotSpotter CEO Ralph Clark declined to discuss specifics about their use of artificial intelligence, saying it’s “not really relevant.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The point is anything that ultimately gets produced as a gunshot has to have eyes and ears on it,” said Clark in an interview. “Human eyes and ears, OK?” \u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series, “Tracked,” that investigates the power and consequences of decisions driven by algorithms on people’s everyday lives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>A GAME CHANGER\u003c/p>\u003cp>Police chiefs call ShotSpotter a game-changer. The technology, which has been installed in about 110 American cities, large and small, can cost up to \u003ca href=\"https://www.shotspotter.com/system/content-uploads/ShotSpotter_Fact_Sheet_-_final_draft_12.13.pdf\">$95,000 per square mile per\u003c/a> year. The system is usually placed at the request of local officials in neighborhoods deemed to be the highest risk for gun violence, which are often disproportionately Black and Latino communities. Law enforcement officials say it helps get officers to crime scenes quicker and helps cash-strapped public safety agencies better deploy their resources.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“ShotSpotter has turned into one of the most important cogs in our wheel of addressing gun violence,” said Toledo, Ohio Police Chief George Kral during a 2019 International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers who took a look at ShotSpotter’s impacts in communities where it is used came to a different conclusion. \u003ca href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33929640/\">One study\u003c/a> published in April in the peer-reviewed Journal of Urban Health examined ShotSpotter in 68 large, metropolitan counties from 1999 to 2016, the largest review to date. It found that the technology didn’t reduce gun violence or increase community safety.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The evidence that we’ve produced suggests that the technology does not reduce firearm violence in the long-term, and the implementation of the technology does not lead to increased murder or weapons related arrests,” said lead author Mitch Doucette.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter installs its acoustic sensors on buildings, telephone poles and street lights. Employees in a dark, restricted-access room study hundreds of thousands of gunfire alerts on multiple computer screens at the company’s headquarters about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of San Francisco or a newer office in Washington.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Forensic tools such as DNA and ballistics evidence used by prosecutors have had their methodologies examined in painstaking detail for decades, but ShotSpotter claims its software is proprietary, and won’t release its algorithm. The company’s privacy policy says sensor locations aren’t divulged to police departments, although community members can see them on their street lamps. The company has shielded internal data and records revealing the system’s inner workings, leaving defense attorneys no way of interrogating the technology to understand the specifics of how it works.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have a constitutional right to confront all witnesses and evidence against us, but in this case the ShotSpotter system is the accuser, and there is no way to determine if it’s accurate, monitored, calibrated or if someone’s added something,” said Katie Higgins, a defense attorney who has successfully fought ShotSpotter evidence. “The most serious consequence is being convicted of a crime you didn’t commit using this as evidence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Silicon Valley startup launched 25 years ago backed by venture capitalist Gary Lauder, heir to Estée Lauder’s makeup fortune. Today, the billionaire remains the company’s largest investor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter’s profile has grown in recent years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. government has spent more than $6.9 million on gunshot detection systems, including ShotSpotter, in discretionary grants and earmarked funds, the Justice Department said in response to questions from AP. States and local governments have spent millions more, from a separate pool of federal tax dollars, to purchase the system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company’s share price has more than doubled since it went public in 2017 and it posted revenue of nearly $30 million in the first half of 2021. It’s hardly ubiquitous, however. ShotSpotter's website lists 119 communities in the U.S., the Caribbean and South Africa where it operates. The company says it has deployed 18,000 sensors covering 810 square miles (2,100 square kilometers).\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2018, it acquired a predictive policing company called HunchLab, which integrates its AI models with ShotSpotter’s gunshot detection data to purportedly predict crime before it happens.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That system can “forecast when and where crimes are likely to emerge and recommends specific patrols and tactics that can deter these events,” according to the company’s 2020 \u003ca href=\"https://ir.shotspotter.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-21-016134/0001564590-21-016134.pdf\">annual report\u003c/a> filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it plans to expand in Latin America and other regions of the world. It recently appointed Roberta Jacobson, the former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, to its board.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late last year, a Trump administration commission on law enforcement urged increased funding for systems like ShotSpotter to “combat firearm crime and violence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And amid rising homicides, this spring, the Biden administration nominated David Chipman, a former ShotSpotter executive, to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In June, President Joe Biden encouraged mayors to use American Rescue Plan funds — aimed at speeding up the U.S. pandemic recovery — to buy gunshot detection systems, “to better see and stop gun violence in their communities.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>‘SOMETHING IN ME HAD JUST DIED’\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a balmy Sunday evening in May 2020, Williams and his wife Jacqueline Anderson settled in at their apartment building on Chicago’s South Side. They fed their Rottweiler Lily and German shepherd Shibey. Anderson fell asleep. Williams said he left the house to buy cigarettes at a gas station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Looters had beaten him to it. Six days before in Minneapolis, George Floyd had been killed by police Officer Derek Chauvin. Four hundred miles away (640 kilometers), in Williams’ neighborhood, outrage boiled over. Shops were torn up, store windows broken, fires burned.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams found the gas station destroyed, so he said he made a U-turn to head home on South Stony Island Avenue. Before he reached East 63rd Street, Williams said Safarian Herring, a 25-year-old he said he had seen around the neighborhood, waved him down for a ride.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I didn’t feel threatened or anything because I’ve seen him before, around. So, I said yes. And he got in the front seat, and we took off,” Williams said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>According to documents AP obtained through an open records request, Williams told police that as he approached an intersection another vehicle pulled up beside his car. A man in the front passenger seat fired a shot. The bullet missed Williams, but hit his passenger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It shocked me so badly, the only thing I can do was slump down in my car,” he said. As Herring bled all over the seat from wounds to the side of his head, Williams ran a red light to escape.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was hollering to my passenger ‘Are you ok?’” said Williams. “He didn’t respond.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams drove his passenger to St. Bernard Hospital, where medical workers rushed Herring into the emergency room and doctors fought to save his life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two weeks before being picked up by Williams, Samona Nicholson, Herring’s mother, said the aspiring chef had survived a shooting at a bus stop. Nicholson, who called her son ‘Pook,’ arranged for him to stay with a relative where she thought he’d be safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Doctors pronounced Herring dead on June 2, 2020, at 2:53 p.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For days after the shooting Williams’ wife said he curled up on his bed, having flashbacks and praying for his passenger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Three months after Herring’s death, the police showed up. Williams recalls officers told him they wanted to take him to the station to talk and assured him he did nothing wrong.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He had a criminal history and spent three different stints behind bars, for attempted murder, robbery and discharging a firearm, records show.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That was all when he was a younger man. Williams said he had moved on with life, avoiding legal trouble since his last release more than 15 years ago and working numerous jobs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the police station, detectives interrogated him about the night Herring was shot, then took him to a holding cell.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They just said that they were charging me with first-degree murder,” Williams said. “When he told me that, it was just like something in me had just died.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“IT’S NOT PERFECT”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the night Williams stepped out for cigarettes, ShotSpotter sensors triangulated a loud noise the system initially assigned to 5700 S. Lake Shore Dr. near Chicago’s historic Museum of Science and Industry alongside Lake Michigan, according to an alert the company sent to police.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That material anchored the prosecutor’s theory that Williams shot Herring inside his car, even though the case supplementary report from police did not cite a motive, nor did it mention any eyewitnesses. There was no gun found at the scene of the crime.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors also leaned on a surveillance video viewed by AP showing that Williams’ car ran a red light, as did another car that appeared to have its windows up. This detail ruled out the possibility that the shot came from the other car’s passenger window, they said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chicago police did not respond to AP’s request for comment. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office said in a statement that after careful review prosecutors “concluded that the totality of the evidence was insufficient to meet our burden of proof,\" but did not answer specific questions about the case. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As ShotSpotter’s gunshot detection systems expand around the country, so has its use as forensic evidence in the courtroom — some 200 times in 20 states since 2010, with 91 of those cases in the past three years, the company said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our data compiled with our expert analysis help prosecutors make convictions,” said a recent ShotSpotter press release. Even during the pandemic, ShotSpotter participated in 18 court cases, some over Zoom, according to a recent company presentation to investors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But even as its use has expanded in court, ShotSpotter’s technology has drawn scrutiny.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For one, the algorithm that analyzes sounds to distinguish gunshots from other noises has never been peer reviewed by outside academics or experts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The concern about ShotSpotter being used as direct evidence is that there are simply no studies out there to establish the validity or the reliability of the technology. Nothing,” said Tania Brief, a staff attorney at The Innocence Project, a nonprofit that seeks to reverse wrongful convictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://njdc.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Shot-Spotter-Gunshot-Location-System-Efficacy-Study.pdf\">A 2011 study\u003c/a> commissioned by the company found that dumpsters, trucks, motorcycles, helicopters, fireworks, construction, trash pickup and church bells have all triggered false positive alerts, mistaking these sounds for gunshots. Clark said the company is constantly improving its audio classifications, but the system still logs a small percentage of false positives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the past, these false alerts — and lack of alerts — have prompted cities from Charlotte, North Carolina, to San Antonio, Texas, to end their ShotSpotter contracts, the AP found. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Fall River, Massachusetts, police said ShotSpotter worked less than 50% of the time and missed all seven shots in a downtown murder in 2018. The results didn’t improve over time, and later that year ShotSpotter turned off its system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The public school district in Fresno, California, ended its ShotSpotter contract last year, after paying $1.25 million over four years and finding it too costly. Also, parents and board members were concerned that district funds meant to help high-needs students were used to pay for ShotSpotter, said school board trustee Genoveva Islas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were at the point where George Floyd had been murdered and there was a lot of push around racism and discrimination in the district. There was this mounting questioning about that investment in particular,” Islas said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some courts, too, have been less than impressed with the ShotSpotter system. In 2014, a judge in Richmond, California, didn’t allow ShotSpotter evidence to be used during a gang murder conspiracy case, although the accused man, Todd Gillard, was still convicted of being involved in a drive-by shooting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The expert testimony that a gun was fired at a particular location at a given time, based on the ShotSpotter technology, is not presently admissible in court, because it has not, at this point, reached general acceptance in the relevant scientific community,” ruled Contra Costa Superior Court Judge John Kennedy. ShotSpotter later provided AP with additional court records showing that three years later, Kennedy reconsidered admissibility of the ShotSpotter evidence, and found that it could be admitted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a Chicago case, prosecutors had surveillance videos of gang member Ernesto Godinez in a neighborhood where an ATF agent was shot after dark — but none showing him actually shooting a gun. At a 2019 trial, they entered ShotSpotter data to show gunshots originated from the location where video evidence indicated Godinez was when shots rang out. This month, a federal appeals court ruled that a trial judge erred by not vetting the reliability of ShotSpotter data before letting jurors hear it. Nonetheless, the split three-judge panel concluded that other evidence prosecutors presented was enough to uphold Godinez’s conviction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter says it’s constantly fine-tuning its machine learning model to recognize what is and isn’t a gunshot sound by getting detectives and investigators to add crime scene observations to its system. As a part of that process, which they call “ground truth,” ShotSpotter asks patrol officers to add and notate shell casings, bullet holes, gather witness testimony and other “evidence of gunfire” using its software.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have the opportunity to make the machine classification better and better and better because we get real-world feedback loops from humans,” Clark said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several experts warned that training an algorithm based on a set of observations submitted by police risks contaminating the model if harried officers — perhaps inadvertently — feed it incomplete or incorrect data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m kind of aghast,” said Clare Garvie, a senior associate with the Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law. “You are building an inherent uncertainty into that system, and you are telling that system it’s fine. You are contaminating the reliability of your system.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter said the more data it receives from police, the more accurate its model becomes. The company says their system is accurate 97% of the time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the small number of cases where ShotSpotter is incorrect, providing feedback to the algorithm can improve accuracy,” the company said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beyond the ShotSpotter algorithm, other questions have been raised about how the company operates.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Court records show that in some cases, employees have changed sounds detected by the system to say that they are gunshots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>During 2016 testimony in a Rochester, New York, officer-involved shooting trial, ShotSpotter’s engineer Paul Greene was pressed to explain why one of its employees reclassified sounds from a helicopter to a bullet. The reason? He said its customer, in this case the Rochester Police Department, told them to.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prosecutor in that case replied: “Is that something that occurs in the regular course of business at ShotSpotter?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Yes, it is. It happens all the time,” said Greene. “Typically, you know, we trust our law enforcement customers to be really upfront and honest with us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Testifying in a 2017 San Francisco murder trial, Greene gave similar testimony that an analyst had moved the location of its initial alert a block away, suddenly matching the scene of the crime.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s not perfect. The dot on the map is simply a starting point,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the Williams case, evidence in pretrial hearings shows that ShotSpotter initially said the noise the sensor picked up was a firecracker, a classification the company’s algorithm made with 98% confidence. But a ShotSpotter employee relabeled the noise as a gunshot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Later, ShotSpotter senior technical support engineer Walter Collier changed the reported Chicago address of the sound to the street where Williams was driving, about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away, according to court documents. ShotSpotter said Collier corrected the report to match the actual location that the sensors had identified. The company later provided AP with a copy of the full real-time alert, which contained a street address, location maps and latitude and longitude coordinates as did the second, detailed forensic analysis Collier prepared. The assigned street address changed from the first to the second report, but the location identified on the maps and GPS coordinates in both reports remained around the same intersection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Collier worked for the Chicago Police Department for more than two decades before joining ShotSpotter, according to his LinkedIn profile. After Williams was sent to jail, his attorney requested more information about Collier’s training. The attorney, Brendan Max, said he was shocked by the company’s response.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In court filings, ShotSpotter acknowledged: “Our experts are trained using a variety of ‘on the job’ training sessions, and transfer of knowledge from our scientists and other experienced employees. As such no official or formal training materials exist for our forensic experts.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Law enforcement officials in Chicago continue to stand by their use of ShotSpotter. \u003ca href=\"http://ecm.chicago.gov/eSMARTContracts/service/dpsweb/ViewDPSWeb.zul\">Chicago’s three-year, $33 million contract,\u003c/a> signed ​​in 2018, makes the city ShotSpotter’s largest customer. ShotSpotter has been at the heart of the police department’s “intelligence-action cycle” for predictive policing that uses gunshot alerts to “identify areas of risk,” according to a presentation obtained by AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late last month, on July 22, Attorney General Merrick Garland flew to Chicago to announce a new initiative to combat gun violence and toured a police precinct, looking on as officials showed him how they use ShotSpotter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next day, Williams hobbled into Courtroom 500 leaning on his wooden cane, dressed in tan jail garb and sandals, as a sheriff’s deputy towered over him. He had been locked up for 11 months.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams lifted his head to the famously irascible Judge Vincent Gaughan. The 79-year-old Vietnam veteran looked back from high on his bench and told Williams his case was dismissed. The reason: insufficient evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter maintains it had warned prosecutors not to rely on its technology to detect gunshots fired inside vehicles or buildings. The company said the disclaimer can be found in the small print \u003ca href=\"https://webapps1.chicago.gov/vcsearch/city/vendors/102512086A\">embedded in its contract \u003c/a> with Chicago police.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the company declined to say at what point during Williams’ nearly yearlong incarceration it got in touch with prosecutors, or why it prepared a forensic report for a gunshot that allegedly was fired in Williams’ vehicle, given the fact that the system had trouble identifying gunshots in enclosed spaces. The report itself contained contradictory information suggesting the technology did, in fact, work inside cars. Clark, the company’s CEO, declined to comment on the case, but in a follow-up statement, the company equivocated, telling AP that under “certain conditions,” the system can actually pick up gunshots inside vehicles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Max, Williams’ attorney, said prosecutors never disclosed any of this information to him, and instead dropped charges two months after he subpoenaed ShotSpotter for the company’s correspondence with state’s attorneys.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The judge agreed to schedule a hearing in the coming weeks about whether to release ShotSpotter’s operating protocol and other documents the company wants to keep secret. Max, who requested it, said such material could be used to cast doubt on the validity and reliability of ShotSpotter evidence in cases nationwide.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My client did not deserve to have his liberty taken away based on unscientific, unproven evidence,” Max said. “Given the history of flawed forensic evidence in our courts, we can’t let ShotSpotter be the next thing that racks up wrongful convictions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the evening of July 23, Williams walked out of Cook County Jail into the hot Chicago night. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He was picked up by his attorney, and Anderson, his wife of 20 years, was waiting at home. When her husband stepped out of his attorney’s car, she took him in her arms and cried.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That first night at home, Anderson made ribs and chicken, cornbread and macaroni and cheese.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Williams couldn’t eat on his own. He’d beat COVID-19 twice while in jail, but had developed an uncontrollable tremor in his hand that kept him from holding a spoon. So Anderson fed him. And as they sat together on the couch, she held onto his arm to try and stop the shaking.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For her part, Herring’s mother believes police had the right suspect in Williams. She blames ShotSpotter for botching the case by passing on, then withdrawing what she called flimsy data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams remains shaken by his ordeal. He said he doesn’t feel safe in his hometown anymore. When he walks through the neighborhood he scans for the little microphones that almost sent him to prison for life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The only places these devices are installed are in poor Black communities, nowhere else,” he said. “How many of us will end up in this same situation?\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story was originally published on August 19, 2021. The Associated Press reported that a ShotSpotter engineer changed the reported Chicago address of a sound the company labeled a gunshot to the street where Michael Williams was driving. The story included ShotSpotter’s explanation that the engineer had corrected the street address that was generated in its initial real-time alert to match the actual street address that the company’s sensors had identified. The company has now provided the AP with a copy of the full real-time alert. The two reports the company issued – the initial real-time alert and the detailed forensic analysis later filed in court – contained a street address, location maps and latitude and longitude coordinates. The assigned street address changed from the first to the second report, but the location identified on the maps and GPS coordinates in both reports remained around the same intersection. ShotSpotter says the street address in the initial real-time alert sent to police was wrong because the GPS coordinates fell within a large park for which the officially designated address was about a mile away from the actual location identified by the sensors. In addition, the AP story misstated the status of an attorney who pressed a ShotSpotter engineer testifying in a trial to explain why one of its employees reclassified sounds from a helicopter to a bullet. The article said the attorney was a defense attorney but he was actually a prosecutor. The story also reported that in 2014, a judge in Richmond, California, didn’t allow ShotSpotter evidence to be used during a gang murder conspiracy case. ShotSpotter has now provided AP with additional court records showing that, three years later, the judge reconsidered admissibility of the ShotSpotter evidence and found, based upon the new evidence, that it could be admitted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mendoza reported from Newark, California.

According to recent data from Mexico’s federal auditor, of more than 1,600 investigations into disappearances by authorities or cartels opened by the attorney general’s office, none made it to the courts in 2020.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the work goes on at Nuevo Laredo. If nothing else, there is the hope of helping even one family find closure, though that can take years. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"39c8cfd077ac4755827dace7667f4edc\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"72381fdaa64c428fba4f4d4ea14e7964\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>That’s why a forensic technician smiled amid the devastation on a recent day: She had found an unburnt tooth, a treasure that might offer DNA to make an identification possible.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>When Jorge Macías, head of the Tamaulipas state search commission, and his team first came to the Nuevo Laredo site, they had to clear brush and pick up human remains over the final 100 yards just to reach the house without destroying evidence. They found a barrel tossed in a trough, shovels and an axe with traces of blood on it. Gunfire echoed in the distance. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Nearly six months later, there are still more than 30,000 square feet of property to inspect and catalog. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The house has been cleared, but four blackened spaces used for cremation remain. In what was the bathroom, it took the technicians three weeks to carefully excavate the compacted mass of human remains, concrete and melted tires, said Salinas, who leads work at the site. Grease streaks the walls.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Macías found the Nuevo Laredo house last August when he was looking for more than 70 people who had disappeared in the first half of the year along a stretch of highway connecting Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, the busiest trade crossing with the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Content:566337904577\" class=\"hub-link-embed\">Full Coverage: Photography\u003c/div>\u003cp>The area was known as kilometer 26, a point on the highway and the invisible entrance to the kingdom of the Northeast cartel, a splinter of the Zetas. There are small shops with food and coffee. Men sell stolen gasoline and drugs. Strangers are filmed with cell phones. The power poles lining the highway farther north have been blasted with large-caliber weapons. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most who disappeared here were truck drivers, cabbies, but also at least one family and various U.S. citizens. About a dozen have been found alive.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"944b6df1857a4d3a9d1a2bc7db13ab75\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"2bda523818c84bc9b051306599cb9202\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"33deff8b66e84bfeb6a4f83e5c6c79aa\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Last July, Karla Quintana, head of the National Search Commission, said the disappearances appeared to be related to a dispute between the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which was trying to enter the area, and the Northeast cartel, which wanted to keep them out. It’s not clear if the victims were smugglers of drugs or people, if some were abducted mistakenly or if the goal was simply to generate terror.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The phenomenon of Mexico’s disappearances exploded in 2006 when the government declared war on the drug cartels. For years, the government looked the other way as violence increased and families of the missing were forced to become detectives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It wasn’t until 2018 -- the end of the last administration -- that a law passed, laying the legal foundations for the government to establish the National Search Commission. There followed local commissions in every state; protocols that separated searches from investigations, and a temporary and independent body of national and international technical experts supported by the U.N. to help clear the backlog of unidentified remains.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The official total of the missing stands at 98,356. Even without the civil wars or military dictatorships that afflicted other Latin American countries, Mexico’s disappeared are exceeded in the region only by war-torn Colombia. Unlike other countries, Mexico's challenge still has no end: authorities and families search for people who disappeared in the 1960s and those who went missing today. \u003c/p>\u003cp>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's government was the first to recognize the extent of the problem, to talk of “extermination sites” and to mount effective searches. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But he also promised in 2019 that authorities would have all the resources they needed. The national commission, which was supposed to have 352 employees this year, still has just 89. And Macías’ state commission has 22 positions budgeted, but has only filled a dozen slots. There the issue isn’t money; the difficulty is finding applicants who pass background checks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Disappearances are considered the perfect crime because without a body, there’s no crime. And the cartels are expert at ensuring that there is no body.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If a criminal group has total control of an area they do what we call ‘kitchens,’ because they feel comfortable” burning bodies openly, Macías said. “In areas that are not theirs and where the other side could easily see the smoke, they dig graves.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2009, at the other end of the border, a member of the Tijuana cartel confessed to having “cooked” some 300 victims in caustic lye. Eight years later, a report from a public university investigation center showed that what officially had been a jail in the border city of Piedras Negras, was actually a Zetas command center and crematorium.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"02732c3ec9a34b8b81e9b7b330c20136\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"9b6312cdb73c4ed6bcedfb3b2a1cae81\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"8a87ee4bc27a4a37a53ef528af1a78c8\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Perhaps the largest such site was yet another border setting near the mouth of the Rio Grande called “the dungeon,” in territory controlled by the Gulf cartel. The memory still stirs Macías. The first time he went he saw “pelvis, skulls, femurs, everything just lying there and I said to myself, ‘It can’t be.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities have recovered more than 1,100 pounds of bones at the site so far. \u003c/p>\u003cp>According to the Tamaulipas state forensic service, some 15 “extermination sites” have been found. There are also burial sites: In 2010, graves containing 191 bodies were found along one of the main migratory routes through Tamaulipas to the border. In 2014, 43 students disappeared in the southern state of Guerrero. Only three have been identified from pieces of burnt bones.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the extermination sites have been found by family members who follow up leads themselves with or without the support and protection of authorities. Such search groups exist in nearly every state. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the families, the discoveries inspire both hope and pain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It brings together a lot of emotions,” said a woman who has been searching for her husband since 2014 and two brothers who disappeared later. Like thousands of relatives across Mexico, she has made the search for her loved ones her life. “It makes you happy to find (a site), but at the moment you see things the way they are, you nosedive.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The woman, who requested anonymity because of safety concerns, was present for the discovery of two sites last year. When she entered the Nuevo Laredo location with Macías, she could only cry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A few months earlier, she had found the site in central Tamaulipas where she believes her loved ones are. That day, accompanied by the state search commission and escorted by the National Guard, they entered the brush in search of a drug camp.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m not well psychologically after that,” she said as she showed photos of the deep graves where burnt remains were buried, some wrapped in barbed wire. They recovered around a thousand teeth, she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a recent day in Nuevo Laredo, gloved hands sifted through the dirt, separating out bits of bone: a piece of a jaw, a skull fragment, a vertebra. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The work is hard. The forensic technicians clear brush and then dig. Some days the temperature hovers around freezing, others it’s above 100 degrees. They wear head-to-toe white protective suits and are constantly guarded. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Security is a concern, and so authorities have separated the search function from the investigations -- the cartels appear less concerned with those just looking for bones, though anything they find could eventually become evidence in a prosecution. Each day before dusk, they are escorted to a safe house and don’t leave except to return the next day to the site. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"517b7960451a4067a3b2276c3af02a4a\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When cartel violence exploded in Tamaulipas in 2010, the capital’s morgue had space for six bodies. In a single massacre that year, a cartel killed 72 migrants. In those days, the Interamerican Commission of Human Rights denounced serious negligence in Tamaulipas’s forensic work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pedro Sosa, director of the state’s forensic services, said that their way of working changed radically in 2018 with the establishment of the identification team. But it’s not enough. “A single forensic anthropologist in the whole state is not compatible with all of this work.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It can take four months for the Nuevo Laredo remains to be cleaned, processed and arrive to the genetic lab. It can take longer if something urgent emerges like in January of last year, when nearly 20 people -- mostly migrants -- were incinerated in an attack near the border. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if they manage to extract DNA, identification isn’t assured because the profile will only automatically be crossed with a state database. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It could be years before the profile is added to one of the national databases. In 2020, the federal auditor said that that system had only 7,600 registered disappeared and 6,500 registered dead.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though the federal law calls for a system in which various databases can interact, that doesn’t exist, said Marlene Herbig, of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Each state or federal database of fingerprints or genetic profiles is like an island, despite calls for bridges to connect them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>No one can estimate how much money is needed or how many years it could take to see significant results in Mexico’s efforts to locate and identify the disappeared. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Herbig offered a clue: A similar effort mounted on the island of Cyprus took 10 years to identify 200 disappeared in the conflict between Greece and Turkey during the latter half of the last century. And there are many thousands more missing in Mexico than there were in Cyprus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This issue is a monster,” Macías said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"6f8b0776e5cf4a228cfe0a41ae16ed17\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"cc9b202d99944590b33a1c4e86f7eb49\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"ce12b7593cb041e0ab9ba3b459fe386c\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writer Alfredo Peña in Ciudad Victoria contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":"2022-03-01 04:50:00","storyLayout":{"type":"featured","background":"light"},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"APInvestigations","name":"AP Investigations","canonicalName":"ap-investigations","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-latinamerica","name":"Latin America","canonicalName":"latin-america","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-WorldNews","name":"World News","canonicalName":"world-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Mexico","name":"Mexico","canonicalName":"mexico","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-caribbean","name":"Caribbean","canonicalName":"caribbean","isPr":false},{"id":"WeekendReads","name":"Weekend Reads","canonicalName":"weekend-reads","isPr":false},{"id":"Forensics","name":"Forensics","canonicalName":"forensics","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:e382d9893b7b8c02901c3a3177634c46","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:e382d9893b7b8c02901c3a3177634c46","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:e382d9893b7b8c02901c3a3177634c46","shortId":"e382d9893b7b8c02901c3a3177634c46","bylines":"By CARA ANNA","canonicalUrl":"coronavirus-pandemic-health-lifestyle-religion-africa","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>HARGEISA, Somalia (AP) — Safia Ibrahim's business was in trouble.

Population Fund warned that disruptions to prevention programs could lead to 2 million cases over the next decade that otherwise might have been averted, and that progress toward the global goal of ending FGM by 2030 would be badly affected.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"27eacde77b7f40a98079e1b7c27480b1\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Hard data are lacking on the increase in FGM cases, but officials point to anecdotal evidence, local surveys and the observations of medical and advocacy groups. In Somaliland, an arid region that separated from Somalia three decades ago and seeks recognition as an independent country, community assessments by government workers and aid groups found that FGM rose during the six-month pandemic lockdown. Advocacy groups say they've also seen increases in Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan and Somalia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sadia Allin, Somalia director for the Plan International nongovernmental organization, said she was alarmed when an FGM practitioner came asking about her daughters in Somaliland's capital, Hargeisa. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I asked her what she wanted to do with the girls. She said, ‘I want to cut them,’ and that was the shock of my life,” Allin said. “I did not expect that something like that can happen in this age and time, because of the awareness and the work that we have been doing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She said their survey found that 61% of residents of Hargeisa and Somaliland's second-largest city, Burao, believed that FGM was increasing under the lockdown.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mothers give in and allow their girls to be cut, Allin said, “because the social pressure is greater than the pain.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:3fd37fe0-8dc0-11ec-eb64-93a24a60cc32\">\u003ciframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/680335528?h=43883a4c4d&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"426\" height=\"240\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Scenes from Somaliland\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">Scenes from Somaliland.

Using the palm of a female translator’s hand to stand as a girl’s genital area, she held a syringe just above the skin and pretended to inject anesthetic — a relatively new addition to her routine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then, with a razor blade, she swiped at where the girl’s clitoris would be. Further slashes and the labia were gone. Finally, with needles and thread, she pretended to sew up the girl’s opening, leaving a small hole for urine and the menstrual blood that would begin in the years to come.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Somaliland, with a population of well over 3 million, already had the highest rate of FGM in the world before the pandemic, according to the U.N. children’s agency, with 98% of girls undergoing it between ages 5 and 11. The majority undergo the most severe kind, being sewn up until marriage, as opposed to the less severe kinds where the clitoris is cut or the clitoris and labia are removed. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"ad3c00c7b79d42bea3b8988451743fea\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Thorns have been used in place of needle and thread in the most basic of such procedures in rural areas. Before marriage, some rural women are still placed on a sheet and inspected so witnesses can confirm that she has remained “sealed.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Somaliland, COVID-19 hit as activists and officials said they were gaining momentum in securing an anti-FGM policy, a government position backed by the country’s Cabinet. They call it a crucial step toward a law barring FGM for good. That would bring Somaliland in line with regional neighbors such as Djibouti or, more recently, Sudan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The work has never been easy. Somaliland’s president, Muse Bihi Abdi, has said he wants to make the practice illegal. But many religious authorities, along with others in the conservative society, have pushed back.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:385722151570\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (Women:TheeyesofAfrica) - Lead photo layout \u003c/div>\u003cp>Some claim progress in promoting a less harsh kind of FGM, or in making sure it’s performed by health workers in a medical setting. But activists say even when performed by a health worker with sterile medical tools, FGM is damaging and a violation against a minor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The tensions were clear in the Somaliland capital on Feb. 6, when government and civil society leaders gathered to mark the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM, a U.N.-sponsored awareness event.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former first lady Edna Adan Ismail — the first person in Somaliland to speak out publicly against FGM, almost five decades ago — gave a fiery speech in favor of banning the practice entirely. But the government’s religious affairs minister, Abdirizak Hussein Ali Albani, would not go so far. He acknowledged that the most severe type of FGM can damage a girl’s reproductive organs but said the least severe type that nicks at the clitoris should remain optional.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"6fdc38c18b9743ad95f7cebc2cc806ad\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>His comment reflected the thinking of many in Somaliland’s powerful religious community, who feel they are making a concession to anti-FGM efforts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Women are Allah’s original creation and nothing in Islam says to cut them, the minister acknowledged, but he said society must also protect them. He compared the least severe type of FGM to the shaving of armpits, the pass of a blade.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Increasingly, women and some men in Somaliland’s younger, more educated generation are speaking out publicly to counter such religious and cultural beliefs. Some are traumatized by their own experience and have begun to explore the relatively new practice in Somaliland of mental health counseling, even discussing the effects of FGM on sexual pleasure.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"a60617d69fd5457882ce526c69e259e8\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Others who speak out are health workers who have seen FGM’s sometimes fatal complications — girls who bleed to death and young women who struggle to deliver their first children. Some develop fistulas, or tears that allow urine or feces to leak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One young nurse in Hargeisa, 23-year-old Hana Ismail, was moved to write a poem about it. At the zero-tolerance event, she recited it: “I have a mark that can never be erased,” she began, later describing how a knife had to be used to make way for childbirth, a life “that managed to get in.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ismail said she speaks with every patient about the practice and the need to stop it, defying the hush around the subject that lingers even now.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"9b5ed5ebec864b7eacdad25848709783\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Somaliland’s half-light existence as an unrecognized state has complicated its pandemic response. Vaccines from the global COVAX initiative must come via the government in Somalia, which claims Somaliland but by some measures has the weakest health system in the world. Somaliland’s pandemic data, too, is combined with Somalia’s by the World Health Organization, though Somaliland's health ministry in December reported more than 8,300 cases and more than 580 deaths.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But now that Somaliland’s COVID-19 lockdown has ended and vaccines have begun to arrive, the minister for social affairs and activists expect that the anti-FGM policy newly submitted to the Cabinet of ministers will be approved.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They hope an anti-FGM law will follow, but another challenge presents itself, one unique in Africa: Every lawmaker in Somaliland is a man.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the minister for social affairs, Mustafe Godane Cali Bile, believes there is momentum. National television even aired a religious debate about the practice in recent days, giving a rare public glimpse of religious leaders who are against the practice completely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The anti-FGM policy should be approved within weeks, the minister said, “and we’re hoping the practice will be illegal by the end of the year.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even a hard-won law, however, is expected to face backlash in a society where FGM has been part of life for generations. Ismail, the former first lady who runs a hospital in Hargeisa and put forward anti-FGM legislation two decades ago, was blunt about the fight that remains.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is not legislation that will stop it,” she said. “Because if legislation would stop it, it would have stopped it in Sudan, and it has not. It would have stopped it in Djibouti, and it has not.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Medium:346476308085\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Whatever women say, whatever we say, at the end of the day there’s some imam who says, ‘Oh, this is wrong.’ Those few words wipe out all the efforts that have been done.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Ismail is no longer alone as a reformer. Elsewhere in Hargeisa, women are questioning the roles society expects them to play. Shouting and laughing one recent evening, they took to a soccer field at the only sports center strictly for women in Somaliland.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The center is run by 32-year-old Amoun Aden Ismail, who recounted the challenges of having a groundbreaking tournament canceled in 2020 because the sports ministry declared it against the Islamic religion, and of being accused of wanting to turn women into men. It’s not easy, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She is against FGM and speaks openly about the practice with her club’s members. “Some girls ask, ‘How does FGM go?’” she recalled. “Some ask how normal vaginas look like.” At first, the girls laughed at her explanations, accompanied by illustrations. “But I told them it’s just part of life. You have to love your body, protect it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Club member Muhubo Ibrahim, a 25-year-old health worker who plays defender, is passionate about preventing further generations of girls from being cut. “The day my mother did it to me, I said, ‘I won’t forgive you, forever,’” she recalled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That didn’t last, and later her mother confided, “I believe now I made a mistake.\" She has since encouraged Ibrahim to do what she likes with her own daughters when the time comes.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"720c5f3543e24f2a8923699d2f2ada39\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story is part of a yearlong series on how the pandemic is impacting women in Africa, most acutely in the least developed countries.

U.S. prosecutors said in 2020 that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/8cb94d455011f8d78dde058cb51ec69e\">bribes were paid\u003c/a> to FIFA executive committee members to gain their votes.

Chalker’s attorney, Brian Ascher, said Zwanziger was never the subject of a covert influence campaign by GRA. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The records reviewed by AP indicate otherwise. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The primary objective of Project Riverbed was to neutralize the effectiveness of Theo Zwanziger’s criticism of the 2022 Qatar World Cup and his attempts to compel FIFA to take the World Cup from Qatar,” a GRA document reviewed by the AP said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP reviewed hundreds of pages of documents from Chalker’s companies, including a final report, memos and budget documents. Multiple sources with authorized access provided the documents to the AP. The sources said they were troubled by Chalker’s work for Qatar and requested anonymity because they feared retaliation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP took several steps to verify the documents’ authenticity. That includes confirming details of various documents with different sources, such as former Chalker associates, and examining electronic documents’ metadata, or digital history, where available, to confirm who made the documents and when.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Riverbed documents highlight the muscular spying efforts that private contractors like Chalker can provide to wealthy countries like Qatar that lack a robust intelligence agency of their own. It’s a trend that has prompted some members of Congress to propose new controls on what kind of work U.S. intelligence officials can do post-retirement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Elliott Broidy, a one-time fundraiser for former U.S. President Donald Trump, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1e6c8eb4409e4606addb8acc17ad725f\">is suing\u003c/a> Chalker and has accused him of mounting a widespread hacking and spying campaign at Qatar’s direction. Broidy has alleged in court filings that Chalker and GRA targeted Zwanziger with a covert influence campaign like the one described in the documents reviewed by the AP. Chalker’s legal team has argued the lawsuit is meritless, and a judge dismissed Broidy’s overall complaint, while leaving the door open for the case to continue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Project Riverbed ran from January 2012 to mid-2014 and “successfully employed complex traditional intelligence tradecraft to target individuals within Zwanziger’s circle of influence and modify sentiment associated with the Qatar World Cup,” according to one document summarizing the Riverbed effort reviewed by the AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In reality, this amounted to creating an “influencer network” made up of people close to the German soccer official who would pass on views to him that were favorable toward Qatar hosting the World Cup. To do this, GRA would send a “source” or “throwaway” to speak to the influencers in a way they would not suspect was a concerted messaging campaign, according to internal documents. \u003c/p>\u003cp> “These various interactions lasted seconds, minutes, or hours,” the report said. “Regardless of the time invested, the interaction always portrayed a consistent message: the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was good for business, brought together the Middle East and the West, and was good for the world.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>GRA said in a report that there were “thousands” of these interactions with Zwanziger’s network, and that it employed a “multi-pronged approach” focused on four targets – FIFA and its associates, the German soccer federation and associates, the international football community and Zwanziger’s own family -- who would then unwittingly pass the pro-Qatar message on to Zwanziger. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is certainly something that goes well beyond any lobbying we expected,” Zwanziger’s attorney, Hans-Jörg Metz, told the AP. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Given his key role in soccer’s governing bodies, Zwanziger was a ripe target. A lawyer by trade, he was highly respected for leading reforms of the German soccer federation, one of the biggest sports associations in the world. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When it came to the subject of Qatar hosting the World Cup, he had strong opinions and did not hold back on sharing them, even going so far as to question morals of FIFA officials amid allegations of vote-buying and corruption. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I could never understand this decision. It’s one of the biggest mistakes ever made in sport,” Zwanziger said in a 2013 interview. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Zwanziger was not the only high-level FIFA official that was the target of Qatar-funded spying.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chalker also helped oversee spying on former FIFA executive committee member Amos Adamu during the 2010 World Cup in Johannesburg, according to new records reviewed by the AP. That effort involved using multiple surveillance teams to follow and secretly photograph Adamu and people he met with for several days, the new records show. The effort also included obtaining Adamu’s cell phone records and recruiting a hotel security guard and a local journalist as sources, the records show. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Adamu, who has twice been banned by FIFA for unethical conduct, declined to comment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chalker denied ever being involved in an effort to spy on Adamu. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For Project Riverbed, Chalker hired case officers and project managers in Germany and London, including some who had previously worked for the CIA, the documents show. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The GRA records are full of opaque, florid language seemingly plucked from the pages of a spy novel: GRA would set up “Cover for Action” entities that could be used by GRA staff to work undercover, as well as “White” and “Black” — official and non-official — offices to handle administrative tasks. Broidy has also alleged in his lawsuit that such efforts at subterfuge were used against Zwanziger. \u003c/p>\u003cp>GRA’s records said Project Riverbed was initially approved for a $27 million budget and that Qatar had been late with payments and did not provide all of the funds. The lack of money led to staff turnover and wasted expenditures, such as legal and administrative fees for setting up offices that were never used, the documents say. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite the fiscal constraints, GRA said Riverbed was a success. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The executive report said the project had “softened Zwanziger’s criticism” and altered the German lawyer’s “sentiment to a point where he is no longer a threat to Qatar’s retention of the 2022 World Cup.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Zwanziger now believes Qatar should retain the 2022 World Cup so that the international community will become more aware of migrant workers’ conditions in Qatar and push for extensive reform of Qatari human and workers’ rights,” GRA says in its executive summary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fad5d26ed3884f89b599808d4661957d\">was wrong\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Riverbed came to the conclusion: we’ve now brought Zwanziger to our side. Inwardly, of course, I never was,” Zwanziger said in the interview with AP. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a radio interview with a German station in June 2015 — a year after the supposed completion of “Project Riverbed” — Zwanziger repeated his claim that Qatar is “a cancer of world football.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>It prompted the Qatar Football Association to file a civil lawsuit against Zwanziger in a bid to stop him from making such comments in future. The case was dismissed by Düsseldorf’s regional court, which ruled Zwanziger was within his right to free speech. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Zwanziger had more legal difficulties later when he and members of the German 2006 World Cup organizing committee faced \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/51b2685fab2549a49815c24c78d01032\">corruption\u003c/a> probes in Frankfurt and Switzerland.

(AP) — Former California Gov.

He's also on the board of the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In an interview with The Associated Press, Brown commended President Joe Biden for not raising the U.S. nuclear threat level after Russian President Vladimir Putin made veiled threats to use his country’s nuclear arsenal amid its war in Ukraine. Brown also urged Biden to resist Republican calls to increase oil production as gasoline prices soar.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It’s true that the Russians are earning money from oil and gas, but to compound that problem by accelerating oil and gas in America would go against the climate goals, and climate is like war: If we don’t handle it, people are going to die and they’re going to be suffering. Not immediately, but over time,” said Brown, a Democrat.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:393483284474' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Brown spoke to the AP last week from his home in rural Colusa County, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Sacramento. The land in California's inner coastal mountain range has been in Brown's family since the 1860s, when his great-grandfather emigrated from Germany and built a stagecoach stop known as the Mountain House.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The home Brown and his wife, Anne Gust Brown, finished building in 2019 is called Mountain House III. The home is powered entirely by solar panels and is not connected to any local utility. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Brown is retired from electoral politics after serving a record four terms as California's governor — from 1975 to 1983 and 2011 to 2019 — he is hardly absent from public life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brown has organized conversations with John Kerry, Biden's special presidential envoy for climate; Xie Zhenhua, China's climate envoy; and former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. He created and chairs the California-China Climate Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, which aims to boost collaboration on climate-related research and technology. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“No matter how antagonistic things get, cooperation is still the imperative to deal with climate and nuclear proliferation,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, he brings an important political perspective as its scientists consider how to get their message out, said Rachel Bronson, the group's president. Last week, he joined the organization's science and security board as they formulated a statement on Putin's nuclear threats. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The scientists decided to not update the Doomsday Clock, which in 2020 was moved ahead 20 seconds to be set at 100 seconds to midnight, the metaphorical time representing global catastrophe. They did, however, warn Russia's invasion has brought to life the “nightmare scenario\" that nuclear weapons could be used to escalate a “conventional conflict.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bronson pursued Brown for a leadership role as his governorship ended because of the deep interest he’d shown on its nuclear work and his capacity to understand big threats.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He thinks about existential risk,” Bronson said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Indeed, Brown is a deep thinker on any number of issues, from hummingbirds to the very meaning of life and death. He trained to be a Jesuit priest but eventually abandoned those ambitions to follow his father into politics. Edmund “Pat\" Brown was California governor from 1959-1967. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Jerry Brown brings a philosophical approach to life and work, often ready with a Latin phrase or motto to summarize his views. He has long lamented that the buildup of nuclear weapons and climate change fail to capture enough attention in the face of more immediate concerns — these days the coronavirus and inflation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have to have enough bandwidth to look at the big issues, because if they get away from us we won’t have the little issues to worry about,” Brown said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He warned a Republican takeover of the U.S. House after this fall's midterms, coupled with the possibility of the Supreme Court limiting the federal government's power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, would make a climate “catastrophe all the more likely.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Brown has long contemplated the fate of the planet, he's perhaps more connected to it than ever before. He gets his power from the sun and water from a well. Fueled by climate change, California's wildfires have become hotter, more unpredictable and more destructive in recent years and the location of Brown's 2,500-acre (1,012-hectare) ranch has him living closer to the threat than ever. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He hasn't gone entirely green — he zips around his property on a gas-powered ATV. He's studying the trees and flowers, determined to learn their names, and in the fall he hosts friends to help harvest olives, which he has pressed into oil. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He's offered his property as a meeting space for the California Native Plant Society, entomologists, and forestry and fire experts. Last fall the forest experts put together \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-wildfires-business-forests-fires-295c1d3a1993b8580b395cca2fff270d\">a declaration\u003c/a> calling for the state to focus on better forest management to decrease the severity of wildfires. Many of their suggestions mirrored those being pursued by Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The entomologists, meanwhile, spent two days on the ranch for a planning retreat about how to protect California's insects. Brown allowed them to survey his land and two researchers found new species — an ant and a beetle, said Dan Gluesenkamp, executive director of the California Institute for Biodiversity and organizer of the retreat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Brown joined the scientists for meals to grill them on their research.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He “clearly reveled in sitting around the picnic table for dinner and having super hardcore conversations with the smartest entomologists on the planet,\" Gluesenkamp said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sitting outside his home, Brown said he recently pondered what might have been had he won one of his three presidential campaigns, the last in 1992. He decided he'd much rather be in Colusa County.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m very happy where I am — it's a very amazing place. I can’t imagine being in a better place,\" he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He then wondered aloud whether he could have avoided the same mistakes as those who became president.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then he quickly switched to considering why a hummingbird that caught his eye was moving so quickly from tree to tree.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"VladimirPutin","name":"Vladimir Putin","canonicalName":"vladimir-putin","isPr":false},{"id":"Climate","name":"Climate","canonicalName":"climate","isPr":false},{"id":"JoeBiden","name":"Joe Biden","canonicalName":"joe-biden","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-science","name":"Science","canonicalName":"science","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-lifestyle","name":"Lifestyle","canonicalName":"lifestyle","isPr":false},{"id":"Environmentandnature","name":"Environment and nature","canonicalName":"environment-and-nature","isPr":false},{"id":"California","name":"California","canonicalName":"california","isPr":false},{"id":"JerryBrown","name":"Jerry Brown","canonicalName":"jerry-brown","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:6aa25b6b8b67a0988cb1214b48250331","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:6aa25b6b8b67a0988cb1214b48250331","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:6aa25b6b8b67a0988cb1214b48250331","shortId":"6aa25b6b8b67a0988cb1214b48250331","bylines":"By WAYNE PARRY","canonicalUrl":"climate-business-environment-new-jersey-oceans","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>OCEAN CITY, N.J.

All that has just subsided, and now we can go back to focus on learning.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Falling infection rates and new federal health guidance are leading most of the remaining states with statewide school mask requirements to drop the mandates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-87d7bdc811ba6521e32017072d5ea180\">recently issued new guidelines \u003c/a> saying most Americans live in places where healthy people, including students, can safely take a break from wearing masks.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But those hesitant about ending school mask mandates often point to low childhood vaccination rates among American children. Only about a quarter of children ages 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, and about 58% of children ages 12 to 17 are inoculated, the CDC says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois and Delaware rescinded their statewide school mask requirements recently. New Jersey and Rhode Island dropped theirs officially Monday while California, Oregon and Washington have \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-technology-health-california-public-health-c0be203235ff50532167173623e56b59\">jointly announced they'll drop their statewide mandates\u003c/a> effective March 12. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In many instances, the ultimate decisions are being made at the local school district level. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials many large cities, such as Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., have said they'll keep mask rules for now, either until vaccination rates improve among their students, or they can work out agreements with teachers unions, which have been among those most vocal about keeping the mandates in place.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After Chicago schools announced Monday that masks will no longer be required as of March 14, the city's teachers union vowed to take officials to court, saying the move will violate an agreement with the district to keep the mask rule through the end of the school year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In New York City, elementary student Jack Jalaly ditched his mask Monday as they became optional in the nation's largest school district.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think it’s nice because kids can finally see their teachers talk, and I also have a younger daughter who has spent all her time with no face, right?\" said Jack's mother, Andrea. “So for little kids, it’s really great because you can see the way words are pronounced and you can see spellings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But third-grader Derrick Carter-Jacob kept his mask on as New York eliminated the requirement. “I don't want to get COVID,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Leave it on. There’s no reason for him to take it off until basically everybody is safe,\" said his parent, Michael Jacob. \"I want my son to be safe. I’m sorry. That’s the way I see it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>John Bracey, a Latin teacher at Belmont High School in suburban Boston, says he intends to keep wearing his hospital-grade N-95 respirator through the end of the academic year even as district officials are expected to decide on their school mandate later this week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The 41-year-old Bellingham resident said he and his wife have also decided to keep his two young school-age children wearing masks this week even though their district lifted the requirement Monday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have major concerns on so many levels,” Bracey said. “It appears to be a decision made to benefit the most privileged and leaves everyone else to their own devices. We’re sacrificing the health of immunocompromised students, elderly staff and those of us with young children. I just can’t find a public health or moral justification for removing them.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Needham, another Boston suburb, school administrators waited until Monday — a full week after the state eased its mask requirement — in part to prepare students for the transition this week to what they call a “mask-friendly environment,” says School Superintendent Daniel Gutekanst.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He said the work, which included posters and informational videos created by district officials, appears to have paid off, with no reports of major disputes or other issues around mask wearing after classes ended Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Melissa Bello says her two school-age children were among those that gladly removed their masks Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She says her 8-year-old son has hearing loss in both ears and has been complaining of having trouble understanding people in school with everyone wearing masks the last two years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He’s working harder everyday in school and coming home more tired,” Bello said. “There’s not enough consideration for those kinds of tradeoffs in these mask mandates.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Jason Chan, another parent in Needham, said his two school-age children went in Monday still wearing masks — and likely still will through the week before the family reassesses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He believes his children, which include a 5-year-old son who has never known schooling without a mask, would be fine wearing them until the end of the school year, if it came down to it. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Honestly, the kids have been doing better than the parents with the masks,” Chan said. “I hear a lot of parents upset but kids just don’t look at it the same way in terms of this civil rights issue. It’s like wearing a hat or a sweater for them.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press journalist Robert Bumsted contributed to this report.

The United States imports a small share of Russia's oil exports and doesn't buy any of its natural gas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last year, roughly 8% of U.S. imports of oil and petroleum products came from Russia. Together, the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021, which was roughly 672,000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day. But imports of Russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Because the amount of oil the U.S. imports from Russia is modest, Russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere, perhaps in China or India. Still, it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount, because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting Russian oil.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If Russia were eventually shut off from the global market, rogue countries such as Iran and Venezuela might be \"welcomed back\" as sources of oil, said Claudio Galimberti, an analyst at Rystad Energy. Such additional sources could, in turn, potentially stabilize prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A team of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-europe-venezuela-cbe04e87fca44ed3815aba8dd2b65945\">Biden administration officials were in Venezuela\u003c/a> over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. She said officials discussed a range of issues, including energy security.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“By eliminating some of the demand, we're forcing the price of Russian oil down, and that does reduce revenue to Russia,” said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. “In theory, it is a way of reducing how much Russia earns on every barrel it sells, maybe not by a lot, but by some. The most important question is whether there’s going to be more pressure on the other side of the Atlantic.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW COULD A RUSSIAN OIL BAN AFFECT PRICES?\u003c/p>\u003cp>News of the U.S. oil ban sent \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-05ba4a25cbee9b5281804d3a5b60f058\">gasoline prices surging\u003c/a>, with a gallon of regular selling for an average of $4.17 Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A month ago, oil was selling for about $90 a barrel. Now, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-tokyo-sydney-1ac7c193d204266b2901fe420d32c2c2\">prices are surging close to $130 a barrel\u003c/a> as buyers shun Russian crude. Refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn't resell if sanctions were imposed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-europe-51a9408c615e78d845c2668622fadd35\">Shell said Tuesday that it would stop buying Russian oil and natural gas\u003c/a> and shut down its service stations, aviation fuels and other operations there, days after Ukraine’s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy Russian oil.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to $160 or even $200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning Russian crude. That trend could send U.S. gasoline prices past $5 a gallon, a scenario Biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A U.S. embargo on Russian oil is very politically attractive right now,'' said Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines. Still, the same politicians now supporting the ban \"will come back and hammer Biden if U.S. gasoline prices rise further as a result,'' he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ARE RUSSIAN IMPORTS ALREADY FALLING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the Biden administration and Congress. Even without sanctions, some U.S. refiners have severed contracts with Russian companies. Imports of Russian crude oil and products have tumbled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships” with Russia and voluntarily limit Russian imports, said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s largest lobbying group. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows that imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WILL EUROPE GO ALONG?\u003c/p>\u003cp>A ban on Russian oil and natural gas would be painful for Europe. Russia provides about 40% of Europe’s natural gas for home heating, electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of Europe’s oil. European officials are seeking ways to reduce their dependence, but it will take time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Britain's business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to \"give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports,” which account for 8% of U.K. demand.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Tuesday defended the European decision so far to exempt Russian energy from sanctions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the Russian economy and the Putin regime seriously, but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time,” Habeck said. “Ill-considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have maneuvered ourselves into an ever-greater dependency on fossil energy imports from Russia in the last 20 years,” Habeck said. “That is not a good state of affairs.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak of Russia underscored that urgency, saying Moscow would have “every right” to halt natural gas shipments to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to retaliate against Germany for halting the parallel \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-russia-germany-0d211c6138bb1b4ca57adeba9ca44341\">Nord Stream 2 pipeline\u003c/a>, which wasn't yet operating. Novak added that “we have not taken this decision” and that “no one would benefit from this.” His statement marked a shift from Russia's earlier assurances that it had no intention of cutting off gas to Europe. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Oil is easier to replace than natural gas. Other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to Europe. But much oil would have to be replaced, and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kazakhstan-business-germany-prices-utilities-09ba9bd916525f66cf266ce7b30fa503\">Replacing the natural gas\u003c/a> that Russia provides to Europe is likely impossible in the short term. Most of the natural gas Russia provides to Europe travels through pipelines. To replace it, Europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas, known as LNG. The continent doesn't have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In January, two-thirds of American LNG exports went to Europe, according to S&amp;P Global Platts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While U.S. oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas, its export facilities are already operating at capacity. Expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daly reported from Washington.

Evacuation routes led mostly to Russia and its ally Belarus, drawing withering criticism from Ukraine and others. And Russia continued to pound some cities with rockets even after the announcement of corridors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Such tactics were common during the Syria war after Moscow entered the war in 2015 to shore up President Bashar Assad’s forces.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ARE HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Humanitarian corridors arise when a population is caught in a war zone, particularly when a city or town is under siege. The idea is that hostilities are halted for a certain time to allow civilians who need to flee to do so along designated routes or to allow urgent humanitarian aid to enter for civilians who remain.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The term was first evoked during the Bosnian War in the 1990s, when the U.N. set up “safe areas” for civilians. But the attempt was seen as a failure since the U.N. was unable to protect the zones when they came under attack.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:393483284474' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Humanitarian corridors also have been sought in the war in Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray region have been under a government blockade for months. \u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW WERE THEY USED IN SYRIA? \u003c/p>\u003cp>During the Syrian civil war, the Russian and Syrian militaries pursued a strategy of systematically besieging opposition-held cities, towns and districts, sometimes for months or even years. The sieges rained destruction on the populations, with airstrikes, artillery and rockets blasting residential districts, hospitals and infrastructure. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Eventually in each case, the Russians and Syrians would offer humanitarian corridors, telling civilians and even some fighters they could leave. Most would then be funneled into the northwest province of Idlib, which remains to this day the last opposition-held enclave in Syria. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Humanitarian corridors were created for besieged districts around Damascus and parts of the cities of Homs and Hama. The largest and most famous was for eastern Aleppo in late 2016, capping four years of devastating siege. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WERE THEY SAFE? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Russian and Syrian forces were often accused of breaking the cease-fires surrounding humanitarian corridors with continued bombing of the besieged cities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When they talked about these humanitarian corridors or ceasefires, we never believed them. How can you trust someone to stop who is bombing you all the time?” said Afraa Hashem, a 40-year-old activist who survived the Aleppo siege and now resides in London. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She recalled how during a humanitarian corridor ceasefire on December 14, 2016, the house where she was sheltering with her family was hit by incendiary bombs. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>There were also cases of civilians or fighters being detained by Syrian forces as they tried to use humanitarian corridors despite promises of safe passage. In some cases, opposition fighters reportedly opened fire on corridors, either to prevent people from leaving or to spark clashes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, tens of thousands of people used the corridors to get out of the combat zones. They make up the bulk of the 3 million people crowded into Idlib province, which is surrounded by Syrian forces and is still hit by Russian airstrikes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“After four years under bombs, they forced us to leave, that’s what it is” said Hashem. “They didn’t save us. They put us in another area of bombs, Idlib.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>SO WERE THE CORRIDORS EFFECTIVE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ultimately, they were effective in attaining the goals of Russia and the Syrian government: To regain control of opposition areas. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Critics say Russia and Damascus benefited another way as well by carrying out mass demographic change, removing large opposition populations, many of whom have not been able to return to their homes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Human rights groups and humanitarian agencies point out that under international law, every effort should be made to ensure civilians’ safety no matter where they are.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The tactic of siege-plus-humanitarian corridor, they say, essentially gives residents a brutal choice between fleeing into the arms of their attackers or dying under bombardment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They said the offer also gives an illusion of legitimacy to the mass slaughter of civilians who remain behind once the siege resumes in full force. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is not like Russia can create a humanitarian corridor for two days and then say, ‘Well, we’ve done our job, now we can destroy everything,’” said Sara Kayyali, Syria researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-mideast","name":"Middle East","canonicalName":"middle-east","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-africa","name":"Africa","canonicalName":"africa","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-WorldNews","name":"World News","canonicalName":"world-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Syria","name":"Syria","canonicalName":"syria","isPr":false},{"id":"BasharAssad","name":"Bashar Assad","canonicalName":"bashar-assad","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:5afeb902545d7a9acc764eefd2ae472f","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:5afeb902545d7a9acc764eefd2ae472f","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:5afeb902545d7a9acc764eefd2ae472f","shortId":"5afeb902545d7a9acc764eefd2ae472f","bylines":"By JUSTIN SPIKE and BELA SZANDELSZKY","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-europe-hungary-migration","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>ZAHONY, Hungary (AP) — On International Women's Day, the global celebration of women, many fleeing Ukraine felt only the stress of finding a new life for their children as husbands, brothers and fathers stayed behind to defend their country from \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-united-nations-evacuations-62fa232dcb9d6260fef0e9c7f5386f9a\">Russia's invasion\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"On global holiday, a 'terrible dream' for Ukrainian women ","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"6e9d8292d86743b593413eff9c91869f","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/5afeb902545d7a9acc764eefd2ae472f","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"6e9d8292d86743b593413eff9c91869f","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>A woman, who fled Ukraine, carries tulips she received from a Catholic priest in recognition of International Women's Day, as she walks at the train station in Przemysl, Poland, Tuesday, March 8, 2022.

On Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made clear that his country, Europe's largest \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-environment-and-nature-germany-83aadd6f23b35a7963d5f64618fb8cd9\">consumer of Russian energy\u003c/a>, has no plans to join in any ban. In response, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman hinted that the U.S. could act alone or with a smaller group of allies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Not every country has done exactly the same thing,\" Sherman said, \"but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>DOES THE U.S. BAN ON RUSSIAN OIL HURT MOSCOW?\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The impact on Russia would likely be minimal. The United States imports a small share of Russia's oil exports and doesn't buy any of its natural gas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last year, roughly 8% of U.S. imports of oil and petroleum products came from Russia. Together, the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021, which was roughly 672,000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day. But imports of Russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Because the amount of oil the U.S. imports from Russia is modest, Russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere, perhaps in China or India. Still, it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount, because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting Russian oil.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If Russia were eventually shut off from the global market, rogue countries such as Iran and Venezuela might be \"welcomed back\" as sources of oil, said Claudio Galimberti, an analyst at Rystad Energy. Such additional sources could, in turn, potentially stabilize prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A team of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-europe-venezuela-cbe04e87fca44ed3815aba8dd2b65945\">Biden administration officials were in Venezuela\u003c/a> over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. She said officials discussed a range of issues, including energy security.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“By eliminating some of the demand, we're forcing the price of Russian oil down, and that does reduce revenue to Russia,” said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. “In theory, it is a way of reducing how much Russia earns on every barrel it sells, maybe not by a lot, but by some. The most important question is whether there’s going to be more pressure on the other side of the Atlantic.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW COULD A RUSSIAN OIL BAN AFFECT PRICES?\u003c/p>\u003cp>News of the U.S. oil ban sent \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-05ba4a25cbee9b5281804d3a5b60f058\">gasoline prices surging\u003c/a>, with a gallon of regular selling for an average of $4.17 Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A month ago, oil was selling for about $90 a barrel. Now, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-tokyo-sydney-1ac7c193d204266b2901fe420d32c2c2\">prices are surging close to $130 a barrel\u003c/a> as buyers shun Russian crude. Refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn't resell if sanctions were imposed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-europe-51a9408c615e78d845c2668622fadd35\">Shell said Tuesday that it would stop buying Russian oil and natural gas\u003c/a> and shut down its service stations, aviation fuels and other operations there, days after Ukraine’s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy Russian oil.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to $160 or even $200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning Russian crude. That trend could send U.S. gasoline prices past $5 a gallon, a scenario Biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A U.S. embargo on Russian oil is very politically attractive right now,'' said Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines. Still, the same politicians now supporting the ban \"will come back and hammer Biden if U.S. gasoline prices rise further as a result,'' he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ARE RUSSIAN IMPORTS ALREADY FALLING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the Biden administration and Congress. Even without sanctions, some U.S. refiners have severed contracts with Russian companies. Imports of Russian crude oil and products have tumbled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships” with Russia and voluntarily limit Russian imports, said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s largest lobbying group. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows that imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WILL EUROPE GO ALONG?\u003c/p>\u003cp>A ban on Russian oil and natural gas would be painful for Europe. Russia provides about 40% of Europe’s natural gas for home heating, electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of Europe’s oil. European officials are seeking ways to reduce their dependence, but it will take time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Britain's business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to \"give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports,” which account for 8% of U.K. demand.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Tuesday defended the European decision so far to exempt Russian energy from sanctions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the Russian economy and the Putin regime seriously, but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time,” Habeck said. “Ill-considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have maneuvered ourselves into an ever-greater dependency on fossil energy imports from Russia in the last 20 years,” Habeck said. “That is not a good state of affairs.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak of Russia underscored that urgency, saying Moscow would have “every right” to halt natural gas shipments to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to retaliate against Germany for halting the parallel \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-russia-germany-0d211c6138bb1b4ca57adeba9ca44341\">Nord Stream 2 pipeline\u003c/a>, which wasn't yet operating. Novak added that “we have not taken this decision” and that “no one would benefit from this.” His statement marked a shift from Russia's earlier assurances that it had no intention of cutting off gas to Europe. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Oil is easier to replace than natural gas. Other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to Europe. But much oil would have to be replaced, and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kazakhstan-business-germany-prices-utilities-09ba9bd916525f66cf266ce7b30fa503\">Replacing the natural gas\u003c/a> that Russia provides to Europe is likely impossible in the short term. Most of the natural gas Russia provides to Europe travels through pipelines. To replace it, Europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas, known as LNG. The continent doesn't have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In January, two-thirds of American LNG exports went to Europe, according to S&amp;P Global Platts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While U.S. oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas, its export facilities are already operating at capacity. Expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daly reported from Washington.
